I love media queries, but sometimes they are a bit much for when I just want to abbreviate an element's content for small screens.  Bootstrap's [utility classes](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/scaffolding.html#responsive) are a very handy collection of classes that help you do just that.

Here are a few examples of how they can be used to abbreviate your content at small screen sizes.

**Shorten button label:**

**Change date format:**

**Abbreviate country select:**
